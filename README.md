CareConnect – Making Healthcare Accessible Through USSD
Role: Data Science Student | Product Strategist Team: CareConnect Innovators Tools Used: User Research, Prototyping, Data Mapping, Community Interviews Duration: 3 Months (Ongoing Pilot)
The Problem
In rural South Africa, millions live hours from the nearest clinic. Many don’t own smartphones or have access to data. For them, getting medical advice, reminders, or emergency help is often impossible.
We met people like Maria, an elderly diabetic, and Mosechaba, a farmworker isolated from health services. Their stories reflected a broader issue:
No digital access
Low literacy levels
Language barriers
Long travel times
Our Solution: CareConnect
CareConnect is a USSD-based mobile health platform designed to bring vital healthcare services to underserved communities—using nothing more than a basic mobile phone. No smartphone. No data. No airtime. Just dial a code.
Key Features
USSD Access: Just dial *134*1234#
Health Consultations
Medication Reminders
Vital Sign Logging
Clinic Locator
Health Tips in 5 local languages
NEW: Voice prompts in isiZulu, Setswana, isiXhosa, and Tshivenda
Emergency Shortcut: Press “9” for urgent help
Our Impact Goals
In the pilot phase, we aim to: ✅ Register 500+ users ✅ Achieve 80% successful consultation flows ✅ Deliver 100+ timely medication reminders
Collaboration & Scaling
We’re actively partnering with:
Local clinics for real-world rollouts
Mobile network providers to ensure USSD reliability
Community leaders for co-designed solutions
Why It Matters
CareConnect isn’t just a tech product—it’s about health justice. It empowers rural users to manage their well-being with dignity and ease. We believe that access to healthcare should not depend on your location or device.
What’s Next
We’re seeking funding and partnerships to:
Expand into 3 more provinces
Fully launch our voice-access prototype
Support 1,000+ users in the next quarter
“If healthcare is a human right, then CareConnect is the bridge to making that right real—no matter where you live, or what phone you use.”
